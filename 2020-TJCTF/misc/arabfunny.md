The obvious first move is just to lower the gain of the track in audacity, it sounds terrible.

After skipping through we eventually hear DTMF tones, starting at 1:02.

Yes, I really did spend 5-10 minutes transcribing by hand.

After transcribing, we get:

`116106099116102123098114117104095099097109101108095050052048112125`

This looks like t9 code, but it's actually not :(

We stare at it long enough and channel our inner chakra to realize that it's just plain ASCII (116, 106, etc.), which spells out the flag.

Flag: `tjctf{bruh_camel_240p}`
