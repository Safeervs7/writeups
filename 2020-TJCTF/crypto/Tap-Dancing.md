We are given a string, `1101111102120222020120111110101222022221022202022211`.

I remember seeing this from like PACTF or something. Instead of ternary we just convert to Morse code (0=' ', 1='-', 2='.').

Converted to Morse: `-- ----- .-. ... . -. ----- - -... ....- ... . ...--`

Flag: `M0RSEN0TB4SE3`
