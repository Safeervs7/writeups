> Linked: OpenVPN Config

Guessing from the name, we just assume that we have to listen for some connection.

After installing the config, we open Wireshark. Since this is on a VPN, connections of our interest won't be under the WiFi section.

After viewing in Wireshark, we can just try a bunch of channels until we get to a channel receiving UDP connections.

Now, we just wait until we see the flag pop up.
