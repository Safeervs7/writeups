Now, as we all know, whoever gets first blood on the sanity check is guaranteed to win the CTF. It's common knowledge. The fact that this CTF had a countdown before the CTF start made it much, much, easier. Once the timer hit 10 seconds, I obsessively hit the reload button with my fingers hovering over `Ctrl+C`. Then, when the CTF started, I quickly scrolled down to the sanity check, copied the flag, and submitted it. However, for some reason we didn't actually end up winning the CTF despite first blooding the sanity check, so I think the scoreboard might've glitched out or something.

Flag: `tjctf{so0p3r_d0oper_5ecr3t}`
