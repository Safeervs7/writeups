# ALCAPONE
Misc

>Eliot Ness is the lead on taking down Al Capone. He has gained access to Capone's personal computer but being the good detective he is, he got the disk image of the computer rather than look through the actual computer. Can you help Ness out and find any information to take down the mob boss?

>(hint: Al Capone knew his computer was going to be taken soon, so he deleted all important data to ensure no one could see it. Little did he know that Ness was smarter than him.)

Incredibly troll challenge. All we need to do is to extract the image and grep for the flag format, `gigem{`.
