> My friend told me that she found something cool on the Internet, but all she sent me was 11000010100011000111111111101110 and 11000001100101000011101111011111.
>She's always been a bit cryptic. She told me to "surround with gigem{} that which can be seen from a bird's eye view"... what?

Ah yes guess, my favorite type of challenge.

I really went down the rabbit hole with this, and I ended up researching too many coordinate systems for this.

The actual solution (from clam) is to convert the binary strings into floats, and that gives the pair:
`-70.2498626709, -18.5292339325`.

Plugging that into Google Maps, we can see... an ocean.
Clam guesses again and switches the coordinates.
Now, the word `CocaCola` is visible in satellite view.

Flag: `gigem{CocaCola}`
