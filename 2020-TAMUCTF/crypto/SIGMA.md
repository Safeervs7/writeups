You know it's gonna be a *great* challenge when the only thing provided runs off the screen.

We note that `103` is the first character of the flag format, `g`.

Coming from the name, we know there is some summation going on.

Now we guess that the first "block", `103`, summed with the second character, `x`, results in the second "block", `208`. Knowing this, we extract the whole flag.

Flag: `gigem{n3v3r_evv3r_r01l_yer0wn_cryptoo00oo}`
